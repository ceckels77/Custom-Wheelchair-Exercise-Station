I was commissioned to design and build a custom wheelchair exercise station for Tom Norris of Mars, PA. His wife was the victim of a stroke that left her with limited mobility, so I was hired to design a cheap, lightweight, and modular structure that could be customized to fit her wheelchair and specific capabilities. The design went through a few different iterations of PVC material and stress analyses using Autodesk Inventor's frame generator and structural analysis tools, and a finalized drawing with the bill of materials was completed using AutoCAD. After purchasing all of the materials and cutting them to the correct sizes, I sent the PVC to Mr. Norris so that he could complete the build and add the exercise equipment that suited his wife.
